Hello, I am Cem!
------
Welcome to my personal website. I am a computer science student at Marmara University, currently focusing on game development. Iâ€™m learning the basics of Unity. Previously, I worked as a QA Engineer at Octet Turkey.

In the [Portfolio](https://cemerenkula.github.io/portfolio) section, you can find summaries of the projects I have worked on. Besides game development, I have experience in software testing, simulation, and programming.

Apart from my studies I am part of the dance society in Marmara University. Besides I enjoy natural sports such as hiking, skiing and kitesurfing.
