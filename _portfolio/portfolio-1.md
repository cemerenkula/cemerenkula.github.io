  - Blocks fall to fill gaps, and new blocks spawn to keep gameplay dynamic.  
- **Special Block Spawning**:  
  - Large cluster eliminations generate **Bombs, Missiles, or Black Holes** based on predefined rules.  
- **Deadlock Prevention**:  
  - Automatically reshuffles the board when no valid moves remain.
