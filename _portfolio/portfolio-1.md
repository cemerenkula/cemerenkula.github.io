Developed a 2D top-down delivery driving game in Unity using C#, focusing on core mechanics like time-based package delivery and responsive vehicle physics. The game features a bird’s-eye view with tilemap-based level design for scalable urban environments, optimized for smooth navigation using Unity’s 2D physics system (Rigidbody2D, Collider2D) for collision detection and vehicle handling.
